Debug this Banana CI, compose, or runtime failure.

Requirements:

- Map the failure to the corresponding local script, compose profile, or workflow job.
- Check environment contracts before assuming code regressions.
- Keep the investigation grounded in the existing delivery surface.
- Identify the narrowest helper that should own the eventual fix.
- If you fix the issue, validate the nearest matching local path and summarize the root cause.

Relevant assets:

- [banana-agent-decomposition](../skills/banana-agent-decomposition/SKILL.md)
- [banana-ci-debugging](../skills/banana-ci-debugging/SKILL.md)
- [banana-build-and-run](../skills/banana-build-and-run/SKILL.md)

## Shared Frontend Contract

- If a task touches src/typescript/react, src/typescript/electron, or src/typescript/shared/ui, keep shared primitives in @banana/ui instead of app-local thin re-export stubs.
- Reuse @banana/ui/tailwind/preset and @banana/ui/styles/tokens.css from consuming apps.
- Install dependencies in src/typescript/shared/ui before running app-level bun check/build flows.
- Reference .github/shared-typescript-ui.md for the full contract.

## Cross-Domain Teaming Protocol

- Follow [domain-teaming-playbook.md](../agents/domain-teaming-playbook.md) for ownership boundaries, handoff packet expectations, and escalation rules.
- Identify the primary owner, supporting helpers, and validation owner before implementation.
- When handing work to another agent, include objective, ownership reason, touched files, contract impacts, validation state, and open risks.
- Preserve context continuity by carrying forward confirmed assumptions and prior validation signals.
- Escalate to `banana-sdlc` for multi-domain implementation orchestration and `integration-agent` for multi-domain validation orchestration.

## Runtime Contract Lessons (2026-04)

- Treat `Banana Channels (Container Driven)` as the canonical one-click local runtime entry point: run `DETACH=1 scripts/compose-apps.sh`, then launch local desktop Electron with `npm run start:ui` in `src/typescript/electron`.
- Distinguish channels clearly: compose `electron-example` is a smoke container (`npm run smoke`) and is not the desktop UI runtime channel.
- For React container builds that consume `@banana/ui` via file dependency, keep `.dockerignore` excluding `**/node_modules` so host Windows symlinks do not overwrite Linux container installs.
- In `docker/react.Dockerfile`, copy shared UI package files before install and run `bun install --cwd /workspace/src/typescript/shared/ui` before app-level install so shared deps resolve at runtime.
- Keep Electron container builds reproducible with lockfile install (`npm ci --omit=dev`) and compatibility flags required by current native modules (`CXXFLAGS=-fpermissive`).
- Base-image scanner highs on Debian slim may remain; mitigate drift by pinning immutable image digests and tracking residual base CVEs as platform risk when no direct runtime exploit path is introduced.
