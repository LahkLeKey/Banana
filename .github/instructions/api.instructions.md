# ASP.NET Pipeline Standards

- Use `api-pipeline-agent` for controllers, services, middleware, `Program.cs`, and ordered pipeline work.
- Use `api-interop-agent` for `NativeInterop`, `DataAccess`, status translation, and managed/native contract synchronization.
- Use `csharp-api-agent` only when both helper-owned surfaces need coordination.
- Preserve the ordered pipeline model centered on `PipelineExecutor<PipelineContext>` and `IPipelineStep<PipelineContext>`.
- Register new pipeline steps in `Program.cs`, assign deterministic `Order` values, and add tests for ordering or branching behavior.
- Keep HTTP concerns in controllers, orchestration in services/pipeline steps, and native boundary logic in `NativeInterop`.
- Route error translation through `ErrorHandlingMiddleware` rather than ad-hoc controller handling.
- Prefer DI + options binding patterns already used by `DbAccessOptions` instead of static configuration reads.

## Shared Frontend Contract

- If a task touches src/typescript/react, src/typescript/electron, src/typescript/react-native, or src/typescript/shared/ui, keep shared primitives in @banana/ui instead of app-local thin re-export stubs.
- Reuse @banana/ui/tailwind/preset and @banana/ui/styles/tokens.css from consuming apps.
- Keep React Native consumption on @banana/ui/native so mobile builds resolve native component contracts explicitly.
- Install dependencies in src/typescript/shared/ui before running app-level bun check/build flows.
- Reference .github/shared-typescript-ui.md for the full contract.

## Runtime Contract Lessons (2026-04)

- Treat `Banana Channels (Container Driven)` as the canonical one-click local runtime entry point: launch from a Windows shell with `scripts/launch-container-channels-with-wsl2-electron.sh` (or the VS Code profile) so Docker Desktop + Ubuntu-24.04/Ubuntu WSL2 runtime contracts stay enforced.
- Distinguish channels clearly: compose `electron-example` is a smoke container (`npm run smoke`) and is not the desktop UI runtime channel.
- Keep mobile emulator channels explicit in Ubuntu WSL2: Android emulator may launch through WSLg when SDK tools are installed; Apple iOS Simulator remains macOS-only and must stay a web-preview fallback on Ubuntu.
- For React container builds that consume `@banana/ui` via file dependency, keep `.dockerignore` excluding `**/node_modules` so host Windows symlinks do not overwrite Linux container installs.
- In `docker/react.Dockerfile`, copy shared UI package files before install and run `bun install --cwd /workspace/src/typescript/shared/ui` before app-level install so shared deps resolve at runtime.
- Keep Electron container builds reproducible with lockfile install (`npm ci --omit=dev`) and compatibility flags required by current native modules (`CXXFLAGS=-fpermissive`).
- Base-image scanner highs on Debian slim may remain; mitigate drift by pinning immutable image digests and tracking residual base CVEs as platform risk when no direct runtime exploit path is introduced.


## Ubuntu WSL2 Reproducible Contract (2026-04)

- Enforce the standard Windows + Docker Desktop + Ubuntu (Microsoft Store) workflow described in [ubuntu-wsl2-runtime-contract.md](../ubuntu-wsl2-runtime-contract.md).
- Keep `scripts/launch-container-channels-with-wsl2-electron.sh` as the Windows-shell entry point and `scripts/compose-electron-desktop-wsl2.sh` as the Ubuntu entry point.
- Keep `scripts/launch-container-channels-with-wsl2-mobile.sh` as the Windows-shell entry point and `scripts/compose-mobile-emulators-wsl2.sh` as the Ubuntu entry point for mobile emulator channels.
- Preserve Ubuntu-first distro selection order: `BANANA_WSL_DISTRO` override, then `Ubuntu-24.04`, then `Ubuntu`.
- Preserve strict direct container-to-WSLg rendering behavior and fail fast with actionable setup guidance when display or Docker integration prerequisites are missing.
- Treat missing Ubuntu Docker server/socket as an environment contract failure first; surface clear remediation and keep exit code `42` for integration preflight failures.
