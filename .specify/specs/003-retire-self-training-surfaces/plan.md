# Implementation Plan: Retire Self-Training Surfaces

**Branch**: `003-retire-self-training-surfaces` | **Date**: 2026-05-09 | **Spec**: `.specify/specs/003-retire-self-training-surfaces/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `.specify/specs/003-retire-self-training-surfaces/spec.md`

## Summary

Retire autonomous self-training from active repository surfaces by removing runtime dependencies, updating validators, and rewriting active docs to legacy/retired posture while preserving historical context only in `.specify/legacy-baseline/`.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Bash, Python 3.x, YAML, Markdown
**Primary Dependencies**: GitHub Actions, repository orchestration scripts, Spec Kit validation scripts
**Storage**: File-based repository metadata and docs
**Testing**: Existing CI lanes, focused script validation, grep-based surface checks
**Target Platform**: GitHub-hosted Linux runners and local Windows/Git Bash maintenance workflows
**Project Type**: Monorepo workflow and governance refactor
**Performance Goals**: No increase in CI lane count and no new orchestration overhead
**Constraints**: Keep changes scoped to active roots; do not rewrite archival trees
**Scale/Scope**: `.github/workflows`, `scripts`, `.specify/scripts`, `docs`, `.specify/wiki`

## Architecture Direction (DDD + SOLID)

- Keep retirement-domain decisions (what is active vs legacy) separated from orchestration flow and output/reporting mechanics.
- Avoid new monolithic scripts by isolating policy evaluation, command orchestration, and artifact publication concerns.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Preserve one canonical managed harness in `.github/workflows/banana.yml`.
- Treat warnings/notices as QA-relevant noise to remove where feasible.
- Keep archival history under `.specify/legacy-baseline/` untouched except for explicit references from active surfaces.
- Enforce modular script boundaries so retirement follow-ups remain open for extension and closed for unrelated rewrites.
