# Implementation Plan: 060-frontend-e2e-playwright-harness

**Branch**: `060-frontend-e2e-playwright-harness` | **Date**: 2026-05-03 | **Spec**: spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `.specify/specs/060-frontend-e2e-playwright-harness/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `specify plan` command. See `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
-->

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.3 / React 18+
**Primary Dependencies**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Vitest, Playwright
**Storage**: LocalStorage for state; remote API for persistence
**Testing**: Vitest for unit, Playwright for E2E
**Target Platform**: Web (Chrome, Firefox, Safari); Electron; React Native
**Project Type**: Multi-platform frontend application
**Performance Goals**: 60fps UI, <1s page load, LCP <2.5s
**Constraints**: Offline-capable, cross-browser compatible, WCAG 2.2 accessible
**Scale/Scope**: 3 channels, 5+ screens, shared UI components

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Structure Decision**: Playwright harness establishes end-to-end testing for all customer flows. Cross-browser execution and visual regression are supported.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
