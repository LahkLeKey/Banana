# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`

**Created**: [DATE]

**Status**: Draft

**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate email addresses"]
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Users can complete account creation in under 2 minutes"]
- **SC-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "System handles 1000 concurrent users without degradation"]
- **SC-003**: [User satisfaction metric, e.g., "90% of users successfully complete primary task on first attempt"]
- **SC-004**: [Business metric, e.g., "Reduce support tickets related to [X] by 50%"]

## Assumptions

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right assumptions based on reasonable defaults
  chosen when the feature description did not specify certain details.
-->

- [Assumption about target users, e.g., "Users have stable internet connectivity"]
- [Assumption about scope boundaries, e.g., "Mobile support is out of scope for v1"]
- [Assumption about data/environment, e.g., "Existing authentication system will be reused"]
- [Dependency on existing system/service, e.g., "Requires access to the existing user profile API"]

## Constitution Alignment *(mandatory)*

- **Disclosure Integrity**: List player-facing claims (store text, AI disclosure,
  controller support, platform requirements) that this feature affects and how they
  remain accurate. If the feature changes a public Steam page, link the affected
  storefront copy contract and describe the exact text/claim that changes.
- **Cross-Domain Contracts**: Identify affected contracts across native, API,
  client runtime, and orchestration layers.
- **Quality Gates**: Define measurable validation requirements (unit, integration,
  end-to-end, or runtime checks) for both success and failure paths.
- **Delivery Evidence**: Specify which artifacts or logs will prove reproducible
  behavior on supported runtime channels. If the feature affects the store page,
  include storefront screenshots, disclosure text, asset inventory, and system
  requirement evidence.

## Storefront & Release Claims *(required when public Steam copy is affected)*

- **Storefront Copy Contract**: Reference the exact contract or checklist entry
  that defines the public page text for this feature.
- **AI Disclosure**: State the exact disclosure line to be published or updated.
- **Controller Support**: State the declared support level and the runtime check
  used to verify it.
- **System Requirements**: State the minimum OS/CPU/memory/GPU/network/storage
  claims and the validation source.
- **Store Assets**: List the capsule/logo/screenshot assets or the inventory file
  that proves the page assets are tracked.
